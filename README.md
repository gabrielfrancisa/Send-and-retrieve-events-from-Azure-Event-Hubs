# Send-and-retrieve-events-from-Azure-Event-Hubs
This project, I was able to create Azure Event Hubs resources and build a .NET console app to send and receive events using the Azure.Messaging.EventHubs SDK. I learnt how to provision cloud resources, interact with Event Hubs, and clean up resource.
